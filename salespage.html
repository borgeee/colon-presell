I still would have been looking for something else, still seeing my naturopath and she still would have been giving me 30,000 supplements, and I still would have been forking out lots of money for all the tests that i needed to have doing, i wouldn't be exercising,, I still wouldn't be happy and have all the depression and anxiety about where I was at in life... Going down this current path I'm evolving into a different person and I'm actually really liking that person I'm becoming."<br><strong>- Lisa</strong>

        <p class="content-p">Don’t be a slave to buying millions of supplements and food products or diets to improve your health when your core issue is actually cleaning out your digestive system first. If you’re colon is not clean your far less likely to be absorbing nutrients and minerals from food and juices.</p>

        <p class="content-p">Think about it, it makes sense. With a cleaner digestive system your body is processing less toxins and more able to absorb nutrients.</p>

        <p>Colon Cleanse is an ancient formula of 4 main ingredients organic chia seeds, organic buckwheat, organic psyllium, bentonite clay and salt.</p>

        <p>The bentonite clay is powerful in absorbing and pulling out heavy metals and other accumulated toxins from the body. The mix of fibres swells and help sweep out these toxins acting like a gentle scrubbing brush on the colon.</p>
        
        <p>For best use add an enema kit to help keep things moving and for the deepest clean go for the best value full pack which includes digestive tea and parasite cleanse!</p>

        <p>The Heal Thy Self Movement has been at the forefront of holistic health for the last decade with the core driver being to empower people when it comes to self-care. Everything from nutrition to mindset to emotional wellness and healthy relating, we’ve been sharing it.</p>
        
        <p>We saw that people were really hungry for this kind of information that that by creating a community or a hub for all the wisdom we’d been privy too was going to create a beautiful ripple effect of change in people across the world.</p>

        <p>We’ve always believed that the way forward is to come together in community. It’s always being about connecting people - to their health, themselves, and each other.</p>

        <p>We have been doing this by sharing unique messages from leading wisdom keepers and experts that have the ability to help humanity grow and expand. We’ve weaved this into our TRiBE community, training Heal Thy Self Coaches, live events and online publications and through these mediums sharing tools for people to truly transform their lives. Together we're better.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight-blk">This is definitely a MUST DO! If not seasonally at LEAST twice a year.</span> Good to have around just in case you happen to indulge, just a little bit ;-) It's like drinking watered down blended oats, add Honey. I personally lost about 15 pounds. More than that, I just felt better and healthier overall. I felt like I literally emptied out years of Junk, it was such <span class="highlight-blk">a relief to know that this junk was out of my body.</span> What I like best is that the Clay, in the cleanse, pulled out the toxic chemicals from my system, from years of build up of pollutants and heavy metals. What's cool (or gross) is that you can actually see all the stuff that leaves your body encased in the fibrous rope-like substance. <span class="highlight-blk">Bye-Bye parasites!!</span> :) It is now a part of my routine House Cleaning, when the time calls... <br><span class="highlight">- Dan Grossman</span>
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="highlight-blk">I felt so energised and light</span> and about a third of the way through all I kept thinking about was what I was going to eat when I finished and all I could think of was vegetables and fruit.The colon cleanse is great and makes you feel just so light afterwards! <br><span class="highlight">- Kim</span></p>

      <p>When I felt it move the junk out of my body in a way that a 5 day water fast, zeolite, sound therapy, massage and all the other healing techniques didn’t do, I soon realized it has intelligence and power in it.<br><span class="highlight">- Josh</span></p>
